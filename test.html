<p>Because of the First Noble Truth.</p>

<p>Even a rebirth in the Tushita heaven involves suffering amidst the joy, and nirvana is the cessation of all suffering (hence superior.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure what is so attractive about Tushita to begin with. I am talking about a moral life that would lead to enjoyment of travel, art, social interactions, culture, intellectual development, physical challenges, exploring of nature, space and mysteries of existence. And these would be enjoyed life, after life, after life, if one strives in all lives to be moral, to the best of their ability. So, with favorable conditions and minimal suffering, why is nirvana preferable to all these?</p>

<p>What does nirvana provide one, to begin with, that would override pleasurable experiences, whether of the body, heart or of the mind? Is it a continuous state of peace/tranquility/bliss, that lacks suffering? I am trying to establish some points of reference that would motivate one to choose pursuing nirvana over pursuing a moral life that minimizes suffering and maximizes good living conditions in the present and future.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Attachment to all these experiences will invariably lead to suffering. Right now in your (presumably) young life these look like very desirable experiences to seek, how will your psyche conditioned by that chain of experience respond to the eventual circumstances that prevent your continuing to get them?  To the death of your every loved one and corruption of your good health?  With loss, pain, depression and suffering... Generating good karma will not prevent these painful experiences, they are inherent in the fabric of our human lives.   The only way out of the cycle is to realize nirvana and the end of craving.  Then one dwells in transcendent awareness and true peace.</p>

<p>That is interesting, but it sounds like Advaita Vedanta&#39;s Brahman. Where is nirvana defined as &quot;transcendent awareness and true peace&quot;? Isn&#39;t consciousness a skandha as well, or is this awareness different from said skandha?</p>

<div class="md"><p>By transcendent I meant more of a conceptless, reference frame popping, direct perception of reality an  enlightened being might experience.

<p>The extent to which one experiences suffering is different from case to case. For example, one would experience enduring/great joy and fulfillment after a &#39;road&#39; filled with challenges and trials, simply for having bested that trial. </p>

<p>We can also experience awareness and peace in this very life, even if not continuously. For how long does one enjoy these two traits if they achieve nirvana? I am trying to see what hangs in the balance, an eternity of challenges, fulfillments, adventure and pleasure (with their known prices) on one hand; and on the other - awareness and peace? Is there anything more to that? Are those experienced for eternity as well, or is that unknown?</p>

<p>That&#39;s because it is not Buddhist.  It is a nice piece of German Romanticism, and that&#39;s the philosophy it espouses.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great work of fiction, and serves to get some people interested in Buddhism, but it is not a Buddhist work in any sense, and does not represent Buddhist philosophy (except incidentally).</p>

<p>If you like Hesse, Narcissus &amp; Goldmund, Journey to the East, and the Glass Bead Game all have similar themes.  (Well, come to think of it, so do Demian and Steppenwolf and the rest of his works, but the three I mentioned first are the ones I would most recommend.)</p>

<div class="md"><p>An egg and apple are both subsequent generations of a species. It is the same in concept. If both of them come from wild sources what is the ethical difference then?</p>

<p>While there are negative aspects that come from &quot;modern&quot; farming techniques and are not good, they are not an inherent requirement to obtaining a chicken egg. I can get eggs not far from my house where the chickens have free roam of a large yard and a house to keep them safe from predators, in addition to being a variety of phenotypes.

<p>The same types of negative things can occur to pick an apple. Have you seen a spalted tree? It&#39;s not much different than caging an animal. In addition, any apple you obtain is almost certain to come from a living entity which is forced to supply nutrients to parts which it didn&#39;t grow. Grafting is more ubiquitous than caged chickens are. You can&#39;t just plant an apple seed and get the same tasty apple from the tree that grows. I think you are sensationalizing the idea at play here with your own emotions about certain farming practices, which I agree are not good, but also not automatic. It is disingenuous to imply that they are. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t think chickens are sentient? Or are you still thinking an egg in the wild (live fetus) is something anyone would find, let alone consider not living?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your prior post made a generalization that eating an egg doesn&#39;t cause harm. The words &quot;in general&quot; weren&#39;t actually said by you, but are implied in such speech.  If this isn&#39;t your intention, please clarify.  Because otherwise you&#39;re being very disingenuous, as <em>in general</em> eating an egg <em>does</em> require you must pay and give financial support to chicken torturers.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Then you are certainly in them minority of those posting on this site, in fact a nearly statistically insignificant portion, enough to exclude in general statements about egg consumption.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, many people have the same attitude as this, &quot;I have my own egg laying chickens&quot; without mentioning that after that chicken is done laying in just a couple years that they will more often than not kill It for eating.</p>

<p>Further, many &quot;cage free&quot; operations in America have been shown recently To still contain cages, but with dimensions that are slightly modified as to allow skipping the definition. They&#39;re still subject to many of the inhumane conditions most are misled into thinking they&#39;re avoiding when they buy them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What will you do when they stop laying?  I also know people who have such chickens, but since their eggs would otherwise be living fetuses, I wouldn&#39;t eat it.</p>

<p>Chinese Buddhist teacher would call this stealing what is not given to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same types of negative things can occur to pick an apple. Have you seen a spalted tree? It&#39;s not much different than caging an animal.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not really, I want to clarify that you are an outlier and not represented in the statement you yourself made about eggs needing to be purchased.</p>

<p>If we are talking in specifics, in your case, it is still someone stealing another living beings soon to be fetus, then (depending on your view) killing it and eating it.. And in most situation like yours, the chicken is killed soon after either way.</p>

<p>If you are okay with that, that&#39;s fine, but we should be clear about what it means</p>

<p>Nope.  I answered his question, precisely.  He wants to know why Buddhists eat plants, and I told him what Buddhist doctrine holds.  Buddhists eat plants precisely because &quot;a bloke who lived thousands of years ago said so.&quot;  That&#39;s the only academic answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought Gotama was all about questioning belief not assuming it to be so because a guru said so. </p>

<p>That&#39;s largely misunderstood.  He said that <em>non-Buddhists</em> should question beliefs; however, one becomes a Buddhist by going for refuge in the three jewels, putting one&#39;s full faith and confidence in the Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha.  In other words, Buddhists believe the Buddha is fully enlightened (i.e., omniscient.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what he understood or not... just what a bunch of acolytes wrote down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but we can trace that oral tradition back to within 100 years of the Buddha&#39;s death, and the point we are discussing is not controversial in the slightest.  In other words: if the Buddha held something <em>other</em> than this position, we have <em>absolutely no evidence of it.</em></p>

<div class="md"><p>Well, for one, he is a layperson.</p>

<p>According to the Pali canon, it is impossible for an arahant to live as a layperson.</p>

<p>The key text is MN71:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Vacchagotta asks:] &quot;Master Gotama, is there any householder who, without abandoning the fetter of householdership, on the dissolution of the body has made an end of suffering?&quot;
[The Buddha replies:]&quot;Vaccha, there is no householder who, without abandoning the fetter of householdership, on the dissolution of the body has made an end of suffering.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally inclined to not take a pop guru like this as the pinnacle of the Buddhist path. To me a person like Ajahn Cha is significantly more reliable a role model, but I&#39;m legitimately interested in why this man isn&#39;t qualified beyond him not being a monk. </p>

<div class="md"><p>He seemed to be unsatisfied with his attainment to the point that he began pursuing Actual Freedom, a (non-Buddhist) path different from the one that supposedly brought him to enlightenment. Also, he disagrees with the Buddha about the nature of an arahat on several points. For instance, he believes arahats can still feel lust, anger, etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>well, nowadays you can find some Buddhist saying any old thing. </p>

<p>But beyond that, there is a strong desire for all paths to lead to the same place. It would mean that everything&#39;s all OK -- there&#39;s eternal life/bliss/leela/union. Despite the seeker&#39;s experiences, deep down, all the sages agree on this. It alleviates the fear of death and the discomfort of sorting through disparate traditions in favor of something that feels good.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It may not be orthodox nor doctrinally sound, but the concept isn&#39;t exactly new. </p>

<p>The idea of the &quot;three teachings&quot; dates back to the sixth century, ascribed to Li Shiqian (&quot;Buddhism is the sun, Daoism the moon, and Confucianism the five planets.) Called sanjiao in Chinese and sankyo ichi in Japanese, this concept sees Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism at least as compatible, making tolerance possible, or, in stronger terms, as complementary and combining to a higher unity, or even as essentially and ultimately the same teaching. There are numerous paintings showing Lao Tzu, the Buddha, and Confucius together, especially from the Ming dynasty, when the idea was officially sanctioned.</p>

<p>In Japan, Shinto was added to the syncretic mix to the degree that its pantheon &quot;converted&quot; to Buddhism and kami could be revered as bodhisattvas as well, e.g. Hachiman Daibosatsu, originally the tutelary deity of warriors. The idea of the michi/do, or path, leading to human perfection by very different forms of practice, ritual or training, even was transferred to secular practices. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a common fantasy, but running away from your problems or changing your scenery isn&#39;t going to help you find balance and peace.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the Buddhist path, start practicing.  There are dharma centers, temples, and monasteries in the West as well.</p>

<p>In short: <em>keep the precepts, join a sangha, find a teacher, study the dharma, and practice as if your hair is on fire.</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  That&#39;s a very good way of putting it.  Many of the folks who struggle with this are people who don&#39;t believe in rebirth, and thus want to achieve enlightenment in this very lifetime.  At the same time, they are don&#39;t want to renounce the pleasures of the world, which leads to some cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>First, ask if one of them is a teacher-- you want to learn from somebody qualified.  If not, you can keep practicing with them, but keep looking for a dharma center or temple associated with a functioning tradition.</p>

<p>If there is a teacher there, don&#39;t worry about &quot;becoming an apprentice&quot;; just ask if there are courses or personal instruction available.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I understand the question.</p>

<p>Do you mean the earliest manuscript fragments, or the earliest complete canon, or what?</p>

<p>The earliest manuscript of a portion of the Pali canon that I know of is a 20 page selection on gold-leaf, from about the 5th-6th Century, found in a stupa at Sri Ksetra.  It was presumably copied from palm-leaf manuscripts.</p>

<p>There are older fragments on palm-leaf in other Prakrits, such as Gandhri.</p>

<p>Many early manuscripts are available in facsimile editions-- these are often very expensive, but are available from most larger University libraries.  I happen to have a copy of the first volume of <em>Manuscripts in the Schyen Collection</em> (edited by Jens Braarvig), and Richard Salomon&#39;s <em>Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhra</em> handy, but neither of these contain texts in Pali-- most are in Sanskrit or more northern Prakrits.</p>
